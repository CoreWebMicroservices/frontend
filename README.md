# Core Microservices Frontend

> 🏗️ **Enterprise-grade React application demonstrating modular architecture patterns and best practices**

This project showcases a comprehensive **modular and composable frontend architecture** built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. It demonstrates real-world patterns for building scalable, maintainable web applications that can grow with your business needs.

## 🎯 What This Project Is

**Core Microservices Frontend** is a full-featured example application that demonstrates:

- **🧩 Modular Architecture**: Each business domain (user management, communication, etc.) is a standalone, reusable module
- **🎭 Component Composition**: Build complex pages by mixing components from different modules
- **🔐 Enterprise Authentication**: JWT + OAuth2 (Google, GitHub, LinkedIn) with role-based access control
- **📊 Advanced Data Management**: React Query for server state, Hookstate for client state
- **🛡️ Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript with strict type checking
- **🎨 Professional UI**: React Bootstrap with consistent design system

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### **Modular & Composable Design**

```typescript
// Example: Composing different modules on one page
<UsersPage>
  <UserList /> {/* from user module */}
  <StatsGraph /> {/* from analytics module */}
  <ActivityFeed /> {/* from communication module */}
</UsersPage>
```

### **Centralized Configuration**

- ✅ All routes defined in `/app/router/`
- ✅ Configurable auth guards and common components
- ✅ No hardcoded dependencies between modules
- ✅ Easy to add/remove modules without breaking changes

### **Enterprise Features**

- 🔑 **Multi-provider OAuth2**: Google, GitHub, LinkedIn integration
- 👥 **Role-based Access Control**: Admin, user, and service-specific roles
- 🛠️ **Admin Panel**: User management, role assignment, bulk operations
- 📊 **Advanced Tables**: Sorting, filtering, pagination, search
- 🎨 **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first Bootstrap implementation

## 🚀 Quick Start
